## Overview
Noise is a connection security protocol. It provides a secure transport channel for swift-libp2p based on the Noise Protocol Framework. Following an initial plaintext handshake, all data exchanged between peers using swift-libp2p-noise is encrypted and protected from eavesdropping.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
This package has **NOT** been extensively tested in real world applications and **should NOT be used in production environments**. Although the actual cryptography is handled by swift-crypto, the handshake logic could, and probably does, contain a myriad of bugs. Please feel free to look over the code and submit improvements where you see fit.

## Install

Include the following dependency in your Package.swift file
``` swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        ...
        .package(name: "LibP2PNoise", url: "https://github.com/swift-libp2p/swift-libp2p-noise.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0"))
    ],
    ...
        .target(
